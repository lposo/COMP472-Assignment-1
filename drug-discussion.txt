The same model should give the same performance, as theyt are all fit based on the same dataset.
However, I realized that I hhad made a mistake and redid Step 5 in addition to Step 6 instead of Step 6 only,
so my averages vary widely between each attempt. However, the onyl time that performance should have a marginal
difference is when adjusting the parameters inputted during Top-DT and Top-MLP.
