How to Run:
Ensure that you have Python 3 installed.
For this project, I used pip.virtualenv.

In the project directory, run:

python -m venv sklearn-venv
sklearn-venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -U scikit-learn

Additionally, for task 2, run:
pip install pandas

Then, run python task1.py for part 1, and task2.py for task 2.
